-- This is the backend storage of the nntp server. It consists of a list of currently provided groups,
-- each of which holds the information about it's name, date of creation (to create a group one needs to
-- contact the administrator of the server) and the list of articles assigned to this particular group - 
-- each article is represented interanly by it's unique Message-ID.
